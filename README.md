# **Human Cognitive Performance Project**


## **Introduction:**

##### Several Lifestyle choices can influence our physical performance, but how about our cognitive? 

##### In this project, I'm processing a dataset regarding cognitive performance based on lifestyle habits, and creating a Machine Learning model to predict the cognitive performance based on those parameters

### **Tools used in this project:**
* Google colab
* Python (with Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Apache Spark)
* Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samxsam/human-cognitive-performance-analysis/code

### **The Project is divided into the following 3 Parts:**
#### Part 1 - Loading and transforming the Dataset
#### Part 2 - Creating visualizations to find relatioships between the parameters
#### Part 3 - Creating and testing a Machine Learning Model for cognitive performance prediction
